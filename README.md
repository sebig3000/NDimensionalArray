# NDimensionalArray

Generic Java class to store multidimensional data.
The number of dimensions may be unknown at compile time.

## Usage

The constructor takes the sizes into the individual dimensions.
Its elements are stored internally in an linear array in row-major order (last index increments first).
Therefore one dimensional and multidimensional indexed getters & setters to access the elements are implemented.
